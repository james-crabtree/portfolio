          <h2 class="blog-text">Foundations reflections.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            First thing I've learnt is that throughout my entire life I have pretty much NEVER practiced or used self reflection, so when it came to parts
            in the core learning curriculim that involved self learning, there were times where I really struggled.
              <br>
              <br>
            Another thing I learned, though I already knew about it a bit, was that my attention span and ability to focus on stuff is completely and
            utterly horrendus and is absolutely something I need to work on and something that I need to develop methods around to be able to keep it 
            under control and be able to focus for longer periods of time.

          <h2 class="blog-text">Problem solving.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            Years ago when I was first starting coding in HTML and CSS I couldn’t for the life of me work out why one of my 
            classes wasn’t working. It was driving me insane but eventually I found out that the syntax I was using was 
            wrong, which is why it wasn’t working. To solve my problem I took a long hard look at the code and broke it 
            down into littles pieces until I finally found the problem. Ultimately this incident helped me learn a good way 
            to solve coding problems, by looking over the code and breaking it down into smaller pieces until you find the 
            problem. It also taught me the correct syntax too.

          <h2 class="blog-text">Neuroplasicity and Growth Mindset.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            According to the definition on Google when you look up neuroplasticity, it is, <em>the ability of the brain to form and 
              reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience or following injury</em>.

              Understanding neuroplasticity helps benefit people in their ability to learn new things, enhance existing cognitive abilities and learnings, 
              and can also strengthen cognitive areas where function has been lost or has declined over time. In some other cases, neuroplasticity can 
              help stroke and traumatic brain injury patients recover and improve their cognitive function.

          <h2 class="blog-text">Javascript Fundamentals.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            What is Javascript? If you think of HTML as the bones of the human skeleton, CSS as the physical features of the body, then Javascript is 
            like the organs and DNA that bring the whole body to life. Javascript is what takes any website to the next level, makes it interactive, 
            and is what takes a website from good to great.

          <h2 class="blog-text">Emotional Intelligence.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            When you look up emotional intelligence on Google it will come up with this definition - <strong><i>“the capacity to be aware of, control, 
            and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically”.</i></strong> But what does that 
            actually mean?
              <br>
            To put it into more simple and more understandable terms, Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice, understand and manage your 
            emotions and the emotions of others around you, like your family, friends, colleagues. There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, 
            self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.

          <h2 class="blog-text">My learning plan & Revised learning plan.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            My long term goal and career aspirations is to get into the tech industry, initially in the web development industry, then see where life 
            takes me. I’ve wanted to get into the tech industry for a long time because it is constantly growing, job opportunities are very high and 
            I think will continue to remain high for a long long long time, and I also think that people working in tech are typically more valued and 
            treated better by employers than in other traditional industries.

          <h2 class="blog-text">HTML and CSS concepts.</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            From an outsiders perspective, classes and id’s may look the same, they essentially both do the same thing - 
            they’re both used to edit elements with CSS, but taking a deeper closer look into the two, you’ll see that their uses are 
            different to each other. To put it into simple terms, you should use a class when you plan to use it on multiple elements (like 
            on a h1, p, h3, div) while you should use an id if you are only trying to edit a specific single element.

          <p class="blog-text">
            Like a lot of children growing up I took a lot of notice of my parents and my auntie (she visited once a year so I have spent a lot of time 
            with her), how they acted, their values, and the way they conducted themselves. My parents are both extremely honest, hard working and 
            genuine people and naturally I feel like a lot of those values have rubbed off on me and helped shaped me into the person I am today, and 
            the values that I follow and hold close to me.
